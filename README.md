# Cable Help Documentation

This repository contains a few documents intended to guide the person interested to know more
about what Cable is and why it exists. One document even goes so far as to provide a quick and
informal guide for implementing it in any language, from scratch.

## Documents
[intro]: /introduction.md
[guide]: /implementors-guide.md
[comparison]: /protocol-comparison.md

In [»Introduction to Cable for the interested person»][intro], we outline the motivations of the
protocol and architectural decisions. There's also a conceptual description of the protocol, as
an easy and intuitive way for understanding the protocol in a nutshell.

Meanwhile, in [»An informal Implementor's Guide to Cable»][guide] we have a slightly zany travel
guide lead us through implementing the protocol from scratch while making sure to mention most
of the potholes and beautiful vistas along the way.

In [»Cable Protocol Comparison»][comparison], we set out the briefly compare Cable to
established chat protocols along a few criteria of significance to our project.
